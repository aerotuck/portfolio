# About Me

I'm a Staff Data Scientist at [The Expedia Group](https://www.expedia.com/) currently working on Flights, but I have also worked in Natural Language Processing, Ranking, Experimentation, Marketing and Identity.

I got a PhD in Biology with a co-major in Biomathematics at [North Carolina State University](www.ncsu.edu). My major research area was in fish and wildlife statistical ecology.

I live in Austin, Texas with my wife and four children.
